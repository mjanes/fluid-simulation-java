fluid-simulation
=====================

Teaching myself how to do a basic fluid simulation. Also my introduction to JavaFX and Java8.

Currently the simulation is 2D only, though the camera is equipped to do 3D.

TODO: 
- Allow different types of fluids such as air and water
- Allow phase transitions
- Simulate viscosity
